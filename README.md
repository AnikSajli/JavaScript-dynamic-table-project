# JavaScript-dynamic-table-project

This is a demo project built with JavaScript to get a better understanding of JS and DOM. It renders a HTML table from JSON objects by using DOM manipulation. The user can:

- Upload JSON files with table data. They can choose to overwrite or append data in the table.
- Perform CRUD operations on the table data.
- Sort the columns in ascending or descending order.
- Perform live searches on the table data and download the updated table in JSON format.
